# Current Status

RPCh development is currently paused. While we fully believe in the need for trustless RPC calls, HOPR is a small team and our resources are currently better spent on other projects which address the problem from a different angle, including [Gnosis VPN](https://gnosisvpn.com).
If youâ€™re interested in working on RPCh, using RPCh, or have any other questions, please contact the [HOPR team](https://hoprnet.org).
